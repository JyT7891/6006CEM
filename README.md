The dataset is too large so I have to use LFS. Below are the steps to get the dataset.
1. Click on the Green Code icon.
2. Get the github link.
3. Go to the terminal and locate where you want to put the file.
4. Use the following command git clone https://github.com/JyT7891/6006CEM.git
5. The dataset should be in the folder now.
